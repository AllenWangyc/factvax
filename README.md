2. 🌐 Web Dashboard
A more advanced interface for deeper interaction and exploration. The dashboard supports:

🎙️ Voice input for querying vaccine-related content

📜 Searchable history of past analyses

📊 Data visualization tools to monitor misinformation trends

🧠 Insights based on natural language processing and classification models

🎯 Goals
